# C06 Candidate Pool & Source Validation

Selection rule: prioritize topics with **verifiable primary documentation** (OpenClaw Showcase entry + project repository docs), avoid social-only evidence.

## Candidate Pool

| Candidate | Primary Source Coverage | Verifiability | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kev's Dream Team (Multi-Agent Orchestration) | OpenClaw Showcase + GitHub repository with documented workflow | High | ✅ Selected |
| Claude Code (claude.ai/code) | OpenClaw Showcase + GitHub repository | High | Not selected |
| Aider AI Pair Programming | OpenClaw Showcase + GitHub repository | Medium | Not selected |

## Why Multi-Agent Orchestration was selected for C06

1. OpenClaw Showcase explicitly features multi-agent orchestration as a core capability.
2. The `subagents` configuration provides documented parallel execution capabilities.
3. The orchestrated-ai-articles repository provides evidence of practical multi-agent workflows.
4. Tags align with user requirements: multi-agent, orchestration, subagents, productivity.
