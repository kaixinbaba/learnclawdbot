# C03 Candidate Pool & Source Validation

Selection rule: prioritize **verifiable primary sources** first, then publication value for OpenClaw user-case series.

## Candidate Pool

| Candidate | Primary Source Coverage | Verifiability | Priority | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SNAG Screenshot-to-Markdown | OpenClaw Showcase card + GitHub README with feature details | High | P1 | ✅ Selected |
| Tesco Shop Autopilot | Showcase card + X post link | Medium (social post dependent) | P2 | Not selected |
| PR Review → Telegram Feedback | Showcase card + X post link | Medium (social post dependent) | P2 | Not selected |

## Why SNAG was selected for C03

1. Has two stable, cross-checkable sources:
   - OpenClaw Showcase listing
   - Public GitHub README with explicit capabilities and setup flow
2. Capability claims are concrete and can be mapped line-by-line to sources.
3. Suitable for multilingual user-case format without inventing private metrics.
