# C05 Candidate Pool & Source Validation

Selection rule: prioritize topics with **verifiable primary documentation** (OpenClaw Showcase entry + project repository docs), avoid social-only evidence.

## Candidate Pool

| Candidate | Primary Source Coverage | Verifiability | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear CLI | OpenClaw Showcase + GitHub repository README/examples with concrete commands | High | ✅ Selected |
| Beeper CLI | Showcase + GitHub repo | Medium | Not selected |
| Vienna Transport (Wiener Linien) | Showcase + ClawHub page | Medium | Not selected |

## Why Linear CLI was selected for C05

1. Showcase explicitly lists Linear CLI as a community project.
2. Repository docs provide executable command examples for auth, issue workflow, git/PR integration, and structured output.
3. Claims can be mapped to stable documents instead of social-only posts.
