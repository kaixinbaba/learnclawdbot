A terminal is a tool for typing commands. It looks like a black window where you type things, and your computer executes the corresponding operations. Many developer tools (including OpenClaw) require the terminal for installation and use.

Don't worry, opening it only takes a few seconds.

## macOS

### Method 1: Spotlight Search (Fastest)

1. Press **⌘ Command + Space**
2. Type **Terminal**
3. Press Enter to open

3. Click to open

> 💡 **Tip:** After opening, right-click the Terminal icon in your Dock and select "Keep in Dock" for quick access next time.

## Linux

### Ubuntu / Debian

Press **Ctrl + Alt + T** and the terminal will pop up immediately.

Alternatively, search for **Terminal** in your application menu.

### Other Distributions

Most Linux distributions allow you to open the terminal with **Ctrl + Alt + T**. If that doesn't work, search for "Terminal" or "Console" in your application menu.

## Windows

OpenClaw requires **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows and does not support native Windows terminal.

### Step 1: Install WSL2

1. Press **Win + X**, select **Terminal (Admin)** or **PowerShell (Admin)**
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

3. Wait for installation to complete, then **restart your computer**

### Step 2: Open WSL Terminal

After restart:
1. Press the **Win key**
2. Search for **Ubuntu** (or the name of the Linux distribution you installed)
3. Click to open

The first time you open it, you'll be asked to set a username and password. After that, you're ready to go.

> 📖 For more information about WSL2, see [Microsoft's official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
