One command to install, one command to configure, and you're ready to go.

OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot / MoltBot) is an open-source AI assistant framework that connects to multiple chat platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and more, helping you handle daily tasks. This tutorial will take you from zero to running in 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (required, [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/))
- **macOS / Linux / Windows (WSL2)**

> Windows users must use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Native Windows is not supported.

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw

Open your [terminal](/blog/how-to-open-terminal) (don't know what a terminal is? [Click here](/blog/how-to-open-terminal)) and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The script will automatically detect your system environment, install dependencies, and configure permissions—no manual intervention needed.

After installation, verify:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

> 📖 For other installation methods (npm global install, source install, etc.), see the [official installation docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install#quick-install-recommended).

## Step 2: Run Setup Wizard

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

## Step 3: Start Chatting

After setup, you have two ways to interact with OpenClaw:

### Option 1: Terminal TUI

```bash
openclaw tui
```

Chat with AI directly in your terminal—perfect for developers and CLI enthusiasts.

🎉 **Done!** You now have a running AI assistant.

## Common Issues

### `openclaw` command not found?

The npm global path is not in your `PATH`. Run these commands to fix:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(npm config get prefix)/bin"
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Or simply re-run the install script—it will handle this automatically.

### Gateway not accessible?

Check if the port is occupied:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```
