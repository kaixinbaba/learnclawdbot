# OpenClaw Beginner's Guide

Welcome to OpenClaw! This guide will help you get started with your own AI personal assistant that actually gets things done.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source AI personal assistant gateway that connects you to powerful AI agents through your favorite messaging apps. Unlike traditional chatbots that just talk, OpenClaw is designed to **execute tasks** — it can browse the web, control your smart home, manage your calendar, write code, and much more.

### Core Philosophy: Action Over Conversation

Most AI assistants stop at giving you answers. OpenClaw goes further — it takes action. Need to check your email? OpenClaw can do it. Want to automate your browser? Done. Need to deploy code? OpenClaw handles it. This fundamental difference makes OpenClaw a true **personal assistant** rather than just a chatbot.

### Multi-Channel Support

OpenClaw acts as a gateway, connecting one AI agent to multiple messaging platforms:

- **Telegram** — Easy setup, great for beginners
- **Discord** — Perfect for communities and teams
- **WhatsApp** — Use your daily messenger
- **iMessage** — Native iOS/macOS integration
- **Email** — Traditional but powerful
- And more!

You install OpenClaw once, and your AI assistant becomes available everywhere you chat.

### A Brief History

OpenClaw has evolved through several iterations:
- **Moltbot** — The original experiment
- **Clawbot** — First stable release
- **OpenClaw** — Current open-source incarnation

Each version improved on the core idea: giving you a personal AI agent that integrates seamlessly into your daily workflow.

## Key Features

### Multi-Channel Gateway

One OpenClaw instance can serve multiple chat platforms simultaneously. Set it up once, chat with your assistant from Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp — your conversations and context follow you everywhere.

### AI Agent Integration

OpenClaw supports multiple AI providers:
- **Anthropic Claude** (recommended) — Excellent reasoning and tool use
- **OpenAI GPT** — Versatile and powerful
- **Google Gemini** — Fast and multimodal
- **Pi** — Conversational and friendly
- **Custom models** — Bring your own

Switch between models or run multiple agents for different purposes.

### Browser Automation

OpenClaw can control web browsers through the [Browser Relay](/blog/browser-relay) feature. Need to fill out forms, scrape data, or automate repetitive web tasks? Your agent can do it while you watch or work in the background.

### Smart Home Control

Integrate with **Home Assistant** to control lights, thermostats, cameras, and more through natural conversation. "Turn off the living room lights" just works.

### Developer Workflows

OpenClaw excels at developer tasks:
- Read and write code
- Git operations (commit, push, PR creation)
- Code reviews
- CI/CD pipeline management
- Server administration via SSH

### Skills System

OpenClaw's capabilities are extensible through a **skills system**. Each skill provides specific functionality — from calendar management to image generation. You can create custom skills to fit your unique needs.

## What You'll Need

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. **A computer** running macOS, Linux, or Windows
2. **Node.js 18+** or **Docker** for running OpenClaw
3. **An AI provider API key** — We recommend starting with [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/)
4. **A messaging app account** — Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp

That's it! The basic setup is surprisingly simple.

## Quick Installation

OpenClaw offers several installation methods. Here's a quick overview:

### Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install openclaw/tap/openclaw
```

### Via npm

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

### Via Docker

```bash
docker pull openclaw/openclaw:latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
npm install
npm run build
```

For detailed installation instructions, including Windows setup, troubleshooting, and environment configuration, see the [Complete Installation Guide](/blog/openclaw-setup-installation-guide).

## First-Time Setup: The Onboard Wizard

Once installed, OpenClaw provides an interactive setup wizard to get you started:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

This command launches a friendly walkthrough that helps you:

### 1. Choose Your AI Provider

The wizard will ask which AI service you want to use. For beginners, we recommend **Anthropic Claude** for its excellent reasoning and tool-use capabilities.

### 2. Set Your API Key

You'll need to provide an API key from your chosen provider:

- **Anthropic**: Get yours at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **OpenAI**: Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
- **Google**: Check [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/)

The wizard will securely store your key in the configuration file.

### 3. Configure Your First Channel

Next, you'll set up your first messaging channel. The wizard supports:
- Telegram (easiest for beginners)
- Discord
- WhatsApp
- Email

Choose one to start — you can add more channels later!

## Connecting Your First Channel

Let's walk through setting up your first channel. We'll cover the three most popular options.

### Option A: Telegram (Recommended for Beginners)

Telegram is the easiest way to get started with OpenClaw.

**Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather**

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` to start creating your bot
3. Choose a name (e.g., "My OpenClaw Assistant")
4. Choose a username (must end in 'bot', e.g., `my_openclaw_bot`)
5. BotFather will give you a **bot token** — save this!

**Step 2: Configure OpenClaw**

```bash
openclaw channel add telegram
```

When prompted, paste your bot token.

**Step 3: Start Chatting**

1. Find your bot in Telegram (search for the username you created)
2. Send `/start` to begin
3. Try saying "Hello!" — your AI assistant should respond!

### Option B: Discord

Discord is great for communities and teams.

**Step 1: Create a Discord Application**

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab
4. Click "Add Bot" and confirm
5. Under "Token", click "Reset Token" and copy it (save securely!)
6. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - Presence Intent
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent

**Step 2: Configure OpenClaw**

```bash
openclaw channel add discord
```

Paste your bot token when prompted.

**Step 3: Invite to Your Server**

1. In the Discord Developer Portal, go to "OAuth2" → "URL Generator"
2. Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. Select permissions: At minimum, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser
5. Select your server and authorize

**Step 4: Start Chatting**

In any channel where the bot has access, mention it or DM it directly to start a conversation!

### Option C: WhatsApp

WhatsApp requires QR code pairing and is slightly more complex.

**Step 1: Configure OpenClaw**

```bash
openclaw channel add whatsapp
```

**Step 2: Scan QR Code**

OpenClaw will display a QR code in your terminal. Open WhatsApp on your phone and scan it:

1. Open WhatsApp
2. Tap Menu (⋮) or Settings
3. Tap "Linked Devices"
4. Tap "Link a Device"
5. Scan the QR code from your terminal

**Step 3: Start Chatting**

Once paired, send a message to the linked device (yourself) to test the connection!

For more details on WhatsApp setup and troubleshooting, check the [official documentation](https://openclaw.org/docs).

## Your First Conversation

Now that your channel is connected, let's have your first conversation with your AI assistant!

### Sending Your First Message

Try something simple:

```
Hello! Can you help me?
```

Your assistant should introduce itself and ask what you need. OpenClaw agents are designed to be helpful, friendly, and action-oriented.

### Understanding Agent Responses

When you ask your assistant to do something, you'll notice it thinks through the task step-by-step. For example:

```
You: Search the web for the latest news about AI
Agent: I'll search for recent AI news for you.
[Agent uses web_search tool]
Agent: Here's what I found: [results with links and summaries]
```

The agent tells you what it's doing, uses the appropriate tools, and returns useful results.

### Essential Commands

OpenClaw supports several built-in commands:

**Check Status:**
```
/status
```
Shows your current session, active model, and system status.

**Get Help:**
```
/help
```
Lists available commands and basic usage instructions.

**View Context:**
```
/context
```
Displays current session context and memory.

**Restart Session:**
```
/restart
```
Clears the current conversation and starts fresh.

These commands work across all channels and are your go-to tools for managing your assistant.

## Understanding the Basics

### Sessions

Every conversation with OpenClaw happens in a **session**. Think of a session as a conversation context — it remembers what you've said, what tasks are in progress, and relevant background information.

**Key Session Concepts:**

- **Isolation**: Each chat (DM, channel, group) has its own session
- **Memory**: Sessions remember your conversation history
- **Context**: The agent knows what you were talking about
- **Persistence**: Sessions survive restarts (they're saved to disk)

If you're experiencing issues with your agent forgetting things or mixing up contexts, check out the [Session Memory Guide](/blog/troubleshooting/fix-session-memory-issues) for troubleshooting tips.

### Commands

We covered the essential commands above, but OpenClaw supports many more:

- `/thinking` — Toggle reasoning display
- `/model` — Switch AI models
- `/skills` — List available skills
- `/config` — Show current configuration

For a complete command reference, see the [official documentation](https://openclaw.org/docs/commands).

### The Control UI

OpenClaw includes a web-based control panel for managing your setup.

**Access the UI:**

```bash
openclaw start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (default port).

**What You Can Do:**

- View all active sessions
- See conversation history
- Manage channel configurations
- Monitor system health
- Adjust agent settings
- View logs and debugging info

The Control UI is especially helpful when running multiple channels or debugging issues.

## Common Tasks

Let's explore what you can actually **do** with OpenClaw.

### Code Assistance

OpenClaw excels at helping with programming tasks:

```
You: Create a Python script that reads a CSV file and calculates the average of the numbers in the second column.

Agent: [Creates and explains the code]
```

The agent can read files in your workspace, write new code, explain complex concepts, and even debug errors.

### Calendar and Email Management

With the right skills enabled:

```

Agent: [Opens browser, navigates, fills form, and submits]
```

This is incredibly powerful for automating repetitive web tasks or testing web applications.

### Smart Home Control
