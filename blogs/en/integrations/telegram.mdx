# How to Connect OpenClaw to Telegram

> This tutorial walks you through connecting OpenClaw to Telegram — from creating a bot to having your first conversation. Takes about 10 minutes.

---

## Overview

The OpenClaw Telegram integration turns a Telegram bot into a full-featured AI assistant. Once connected, you can:

- Chat with your AI in private messages or group chats
- Send and receive files, images, and voice messages
- Use your AI to summarize conversations, answer questions, and automate tasks
- Access all OpenClaw capabilities from any device with Telegram installed

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **OpenClaw installed** and working on your machine (run `openclaw --version` to verify)
- **A Telegram account** (download from [telegram.org](https://telegram.org) if needed)
- **Network access to Telegram API** — if you're in a region where Telegram is blocked, you'll need a proxy (see [Proxy Settings](#proxy-settings) below)

---

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

Every Telegram integration starts with a bot. You'll create one through Telegram's official [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

### 1.1 Open BotFather

Search for `@BotFather` in Telegram, or click [this link](https://t.me/BotFather). Start a chat and send:

```
/newbot
```

### 1.2 Set a Name and Username

BotFather will ask two questions:

1. **Display name** — anything you like, e.g. `My OpenClaw Assistant`
2. **Username** — must end in `bot`, e.g. `my_openclaw_bot`

### 1.3 Copy Your Token

After creating the bot, BotFather will send you a message containing your **bot token**. It looks like this:

```
7123456789:AAH1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv
```

> ⚠️ **Keep this token secret.** Anyone with this token can control your bot. If it's compromised, use `/revoke` in BotFather to generate a new one.

### 1.4 Optional Settings

While in BotFather, you may want to configure:

- `/setjoingroups` → **Enable** if you want the bot to work in group chats
- `/setprivacy` → **Disable** privacy mode if you want the bot to see all messages in groups (not just commands and mentions)
- `/setdescription` → Set a description shown when users first open your bot
- `/setcommands` → Define slash commands (e.g. `/ask`, `/summarize`)

---

## Step 2: Configure OpenClaw

There are two ways to pass the bot token to OpenClaw.

### Option A: Environment Variable (Quick)

Set the token as an environment variable before starting the gateway:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="7123456789:AAH1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv"
```

This is the simplest approach for testing.

### Option B: Configuration File (Recommended)

Add the token to your OpenClaw config file (`~/.openclaw/config.json5`):

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "7123456789:AAH1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",  // Require pairing before accepting DMs
    }
  }
}
```

### Understanding `dmPolicy: "pairing"`

By default, OpenClaw uses `pairing` mode for DMs. This means:

- When someone messages your bot for the first time, they'll receive a **pairing code**
- You must approve this code from your OpenClaw CLI before the bot responds
- This prevents unauthorized users from accessing your AI

Other options:
- `"open"` — anyone can chat with the bot (useful for public bots)
- `"deny"` — DMs are disabled entirely

---

## Step 3: Start and Verify

### 3.1 Start the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

You should see output confirming the Telegram channel is connected:

```
✓ Telegram bot connected: @my_openclaw_bot
```

### 3.2 Send Your First Message

Open Telegram and send a message to your bot:

```
Hello!
```

### 3.3 Complete Pairing

If you're using `dmPolicy: "pairing"` (the default), the bot will respond with a pairing code:

```
🔐 Pairing required. Your code: ABC-123
Please approve this device in your OpenClaw CLI.
```

In your terminal, approve the pairing:

```bash
openclaw pair approve ABC-123
```

### 3.4 Verify the Connection

After pairing, send another message to your bot. You should get an AI response. Congratulations — OpenClaw is now connected to Telegram! 🎉

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Group Chats

To use the bot in groups, add a `groups` section to your config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "YOUR_TOKEN",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
      groupPolicy: "open",              // All senders in allowed groups can message
      groups: {
        "-1001234567890": {              // Your group's chat ID
          requireMention: true,          // Bot only responds when @mentioned
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key options:**
- `requireMention: true` — Bot only responds when @mentioned (recommended for active groups)
- `requireMention: false` — Bot responds to every message
- `groupPolicy: "open"` — All senders in allowed groups can message
- `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` — Only senders in `groupAllowFrom` can message (default)
- `groupPolicy: "disabled"` — No group messages accepted

### How to Get a Chat ID

The easiest way to find a group's chat ID:

1. Add your bot to the group
2. Send a message in the group
3. Check your OpenClaw gateway logs — the chat ID will appear there

Alternatively, forward a message from the group to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

### Privacy Mode

Telegram bots have a **Privacy Mode** enabled by default. In this mode, bots in groups can only see:

- Messages that start with `/` (commands)
- Messages that @mention the bot
- Replies to the bot's messages
- Service messages (members joining/leaving, etc.)

If you want the bot to see **all messages** in a group (e.g. for summarization), disable Privacy Mode:

1. Open `@BotFather`
2. Send `/setprivacy`
3. Select your bot
4. Choose **Disable**

> ⚠️ You must **remove and re-add** the bot to the group for this change to take effect.

### Custom Commands

You can add custom commands to Telegram's slash menu via config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "YOUR_TOKEN",
      customCommands: [
        { command: "summarize", description: "Summarize the recent conversation" },
        { command: "translate", description: "Translate the replied message to English" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Custom commands are **menu entries only** — they appear in Telegram's `/` menu but OpenClaw does not handle them unless you implement the logic elsewhere. Command names must be lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` (1–32 chars) and cannot override native commands like `/status` or `/reset`.

### Webhook vs Long Polling

By default, OpenClaw uses **long polling** to receive messages. This works everywhere without extra setup.

For production deployments, you can switch to **webhook mode** for better performance:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "YOUR_TOKEN",
      webhookUrl: "https://your-domain.com/telegram-webhook",
      webhookSecret: "your-random-secret",   // Optional but recommended
      // webhookPath: "/telegram-webhook",    // Local path, default: /telegram-webhook
    }
  }
}
```

The local listener binds to `0.0.0.0:8787` and serves `POST /telegram-webhook` by default. If your public URL differs, use a reverse proxy.

**Requirements for webhooks:**
- A publicly accessible HTTPS URL
- A valid SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt works fine)

### Proxy Settings

If you're in a region where Telegram is blocked, configure a proxy:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "YOUR_TOKEN",
      proxy: "socks5://127.0.0.1:7890"    // SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy URL
      // proxy: "http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:7890"  // With authentication
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use the `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY="socks5://127.0.0.1:7890"
openclaw gateway start
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond

1. Check that the gateway is running: `openclaw gateway status`
2. Verify the token is correct — try `/token` in BotFather to see your existing tokens
3. Check the logs: `openclaw gateway logs`
4. Make sure pairing is completed (if using `dmPolicy: "pairing"`)

### Group messages not received

1. Check if Privacy Mode is blocking messages (see [Privacy Mode](#privacy-mode) above)
2. Ensure the group's chat ID is in your config
3. Make sure the bot has been added to the group as a member
4. Re-add the bot after changing Privacy Mode settings

### IPv6 issues

Some networks have trouble connecting to Telegram's API over IPv6. Force IPv4:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--dns-result-order=ipv4first"
openclaw gateway start
```

### 409 Conflict Error

This means another instance is already polling with the same token. Only one process can use long polling at a time.

**Fix:**
1. Stop all other instances using this token
2. If using a webhook, remove it first: the gateway will handle this automatically on startup
3. Wait a few seconds and restart: `openclaw gateway restart`
