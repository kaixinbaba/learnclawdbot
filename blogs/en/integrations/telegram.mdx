# What is Telegram Integration? (All-Round AI Interface)

> Telegram Integration is a **rich media interaction interface** used to **run AI in a highly customizable chat environment**, helping **geeks and group administrators** to **achieve automated management and information processing** in **complex interaction scenarios**.

---

## In a Nutshell

- **The Problem It Solves**: Obtain more powerful AI capabilities than the official App in the chat software with the most complete API support.
- **Its Core Value**: Supports large files (2GB+), custom keyboard buttons, group management.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Let AI summarize chat records in the group, use it as a "downloader", automated operations alerts.

## 1. What is Telegram Integration?

Telegram integration is essentially **a super Bot running on the Telegram platform**.

You can understand it as **a system administrator living in the cloud**:
- When you throw a file to it.
- It can not only understand it but also help you forward, rename, or extract content.

## 2. What Can It Do?

Typically, Telegram integration can be used for:

1.  **Group Assistant** (One sentence): Pull it into the group, and as long as someone @mentions it, it can answer questions, or summarize the morning news every day.
2.  **Universal Downloader**: Send a YouTube or Twitter link, and it downloads the video directly and sends it to you.
3.  **Server Monitoring**: With Webhook, when the server alarms, it notifies you directly in TG and provides a "Restart" button.

In actual products, common usages include:
-   **Private Reading**: Send a long article link to it, and it generates an Instant View summary for you without leaving the App.
-   **File Format Conversion**: Send a `.docx` file, and let it convert it to `.pdf` and send it back.
-   **Immersive Translation**: Via Inline mode, type `@Moltbot hello` in any chat window to verify translation.

## 3. How to Use?

Generally, using Telegram integration involves 3 steps:

1.  **Step 1: Find Bot**
    Type `@Moltbot` (or other designated ID) in the Telegram search bar.

2.  **Step 2: Click Start**
    Enter the dialog box, click the `Start` button at the bottom, and the system will automatically guide you to bind your account.

3.  **Step 3: Play with Commands**
    Type the `/` symbol, and you will see a command list menu. Select the function you need (such as `/settings` or `/mode`).

If you are using it for the first time:
-   **Recommend starting with [Private Chat]**: Don't rush to pull it into a group, test its reply speed and capabilities in private chat first.
-   **Try sending a link**: See how it parses and summarizes the link content.

## 4. Why Use Telegram Integration Like This?

The main reasons for recommending Telegram as the preferred carrier for AI are:

-   **Reason 1: Strongest Interaction**: Telegram supports buttons (Inline Buttons), menus, forms, and the interaction experience is close to native Apps.
-   **Reason 2: File Capability**: It supports sending and receiving files up to 2GB, making it the best choice for processing documents and videos.
-   **Reason 3: Cross-Platform Sync**: TG's cloud sync is extremely fast. Instructions sent on mobile are synced to PC in milliseconds.

If you choose WhatsApp or WeChat, you might encounter:
-   File size limits (usually within 100MB).
-   Cannot use shortcut buttons, only strictly typing commands.

## 5. Who is it For? Who is it Not For?

**Suitable for:**
-   **Geeks/Developers**: People who like to tinker with automation and need API and Webhook support.
-   **Community Managers**: People who need AI to help manage active groups.
-   **Heavy Media Consumers**: People who frequently need to download, forward, and summarize videos and articles.

**Not suitable for:**
-   **Average users who don't understand the Internet well**: If you can't handle VPN or network environment, don't bother with TG.
-   **Pure Office Scenarios**: If the company enforces Slack/DingTalk, TG is hard to integrate into workflow.
