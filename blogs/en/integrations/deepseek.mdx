# What is DeepSeek Integration? (The Cost-Performance and Reasoning King)

> DeepSeek Integration is a **high-performance, low-cost AI access method** used to **replace expensive closed-source models**, helping **developers and enterprises** achieve **an experience comparable to GTP-5.2** in **scenarios with limited budgets but requiring strong logical reasoning**.

---

## In a Nutshell

- **The Problem It Solves**: GTP-5.2 is too expensive to afford, wanting a cheap but equally smart alternative.
- **Its Core Value**: DeepSeek V3 has extremely strong comprehensive capabilities, and DeepSeek R1 has opened a new era of reasoning models, with extremely low prices.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Large-scale code generation, mathematical logic reasoning, batch processing of long texts.

---

## 1. What is DeepSeek Integration?

DeepSeek (Deep Seek) is a **dark horse AI from China**.

You can understand it as **a conscientious shop that serves Michelin-quality food at street food prices**:
- Its **DeepSeek-V3** model rivals GPT-4 in code and general capabilities.
- Its **DeepSeek-R1** rivals OpenAI o1 in reasoning (Chain of Thought) capabilities.
- But its price is only a fraction of GTP-5.2, or even lower.

---

## 2. What Can It Do?

Typically, DeepSeek integration can be used for:

1.  **Code Development** (One sentence): DeepSeek started with "strong coding ability", very stable in writing Python and C++.
2.  **Deep Thinking**: Using the R1 model, it will "think" (Chain of Thought) before answering, very suitable for Math Olympiad problems, logic puzzles, or complex planning.
3.  **Saving Money**: This is not a feature, but it is the biggest capability. You can even use it as the default background model, running tasks 24/7.

In actual products, common usages include:
-   **Data Cleaning**: Throw tens of thousands of dirty data entries to it for cleaning without worrying about Token fees.
-   **Local Deployment Alternative**: If your graphics card can't run large models, DeepSeek's API is a more cost-effective choice than buying a graphics card yourself.
-   **Chinese Creation**: As a domestic large model, its understanding of Chinese idioms, memes, and cultural background is often better than foreign models.

## 3. How to Use?

Generally, using DeepSeek integration can be divided into 3 steps:

1.  **Step 1: Register Platform**
    Go to [DeepSeek Open Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/) to register.

2.  **Step 2: Configure OpenClaw**
    Select `DeepSeek` in settings (if not in the list, you can choose `OpenAI Compatible`).

3.  **Step 3: Fill Parameters**
    -   API Key: Fill in your Key
    -   Base URL (if needed): `https://api.deepseek.com`
    -   Model Name: `deepseek-chat` (V3) or `deepseek-reasoner` (R1)

If you are using it for the first time:
-   **Recommend starting with [DeepSeek R1]**: Ask it a logic trap question (like "Which is larger, 9.11 or 9.8"), and watch its thinking process, very interesting.
-   **Don't worry about [Network] at part**: As a domestic service, its connection is usually more stable than OpenAI (depending on OpenClaw deployment location).

## 4. Why Use DeepSeek Integration Like This?

The main reasons for recommending DeepSeek are:

-   **Reason 1: Price Butcher**: Its API price is extremely disruptive, allowing you to use AI without the psychological burden of "spending money every time you ask".
-   **Reason 2: Open Source Spirit**: DeepSeek open-sourced its model weights, winning respect and optimization support from developers worldwide.
-   **Reason 3: R1's Reasoning Ability**: On some complex logical reasoning tasks, R1's performance even exceeds ordinary GTP-5.2.

If you still only use GTP-5.2-mini:
-   Although Mini is cheap, DeepSeek V3/R1 is obviously smarter in writing code and complex logic.

## 5. Who is it For? Who is it Not For?

**Suitable for:**
-   **Independent Developers**: Need to call APIs extensively but have a limited budget.
-   **Chinese Users**: Understand Chinese context better, closer to Chinese expression habits.
-   **Logic/Math Researchers**: R1's Chain of Thought feature is a godsend.

**Not suitable for:**
-   **Multinational enterprises that must use foreign models due to compliance requirements**.
-   **Strong demand for multimodal**: DeepSeek is currently strong in text and code, native image recognition capability is not as good as GTP-5.2 and Gemini.
