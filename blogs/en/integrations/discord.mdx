# What is Discord Integration? (Community Atmosphere Group)

> Discord Integration is a **server plugin** used to **enhance community interaction and automated management**, helping **community owners and gamers** create **a more interesting and intelligent communication experience** in **multi-person chat channels**.

---

## In a Nutshell

- **The Problem It Solves**: Introducing AI into multi-person chat rooms, letting it play roles, generate memes, or answer newcomer questions.
- **Its Core Value**: Multimodal interaction (drawing, voice), Roleplay, Channel isolation.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Midjourney-style drawing channels, TRPG running assistants, server automated customer service.

## 1. What is Discord Integration?

Discord integration is essentially **a server member (Bot) with specific permissions**.

You can understand it as **a tireless moderator and chat companion**:
- When someone speaks in a channel where it is allowed.
- It will reply based on the "persona" you set (like a tsundere magician).

---

## 2. What Can It Do?

Typically, Discord integration can be used for:

1.  **AI Drawing** (One sentence): Type `/imagine` plus a description, and it generates high-quality images directly in the channel.
2.  **Roleplay**: Set it as a "Cyberpunk Bartender" persona and let it chat with everyone in the `#bar` channel.
3.  **Voice Companion**: Join voice channels, convert everyone's speech to text, or participate in voice chat.

In actual products, common usages include:
-   **Mod Assistance**: Detect malicious speech or spam, automatically mute or kick people (requires advanced permissions).
-   **Game Guide Query**: Connect to Game Wiki knowledge base, players ask "How to beat this BOSS", and it replies with a guide instantly.
-   **Daily Topic Generation**: Automatically create an interesting discussion topic in the chat channel every morning to prevent the group from going silent.

## 3. How to Use?

Generally, using Discord integration involves 3 steps:

1.  **Step 1: Invite to Server**
    Click `Add to Discord` in the OpenClaw backend and select the server where you have management permissions.

2.  **Step 2: Set Permissions**
    Discord will pop up asking for permissions (such as sending messages, reading history). It is recommended to check the minimum necessary permissions and then confirm.

3.  **Step 3: Channel Configuration**
    In order not to disturb everyone, it is recommended to create a dedicated channel (such as `#ai-chat`) first, and set the Bot in the backend to only reply in that channel.

If you are using it for the first time:
-   **Recommend starting with [Slash Commands]**: Type `/` to see what exclusive commands it has (like `/ask`, `/help`).
-   **Don't start with [Enable All Channels]**: Otherwise you will find it interrupting under everyone's conversation, which is very annoying.

## 4. Why Use Discord Integration Like This?

The main reasons for recommending integration in Discord are:

-   **Reason 1: Community Isolation**: Discord's excellent channel permission management makes AI's activity range completely controllable.
-   **Reason 2: Slash Command**: Slash commands are currently the most standardized way of human-computer interaction, with clear parameters and no accidental touches.
-   **Reason 3: Multimodal Display**: Discord has excellent support for images and Embed message cards, and the display effect is gorgeous.

If you choose to use WeChat groups or WhatsApp groups:
-   It is difficult to control when it speaks and when it shuts up.
-   Generated images are often compressed or blocked.

## 5. Who is it For? Who is it Not For?

**Suitable for:**
-   **Game Guilds**: Need to check guides, keep scores, and liven up the atmosphere.
-   **Web3/DAO Organizations**: Need to automate answering community frequently asked questions (FAQ).
-   **Interest Groups**: Play AI drawing together, share Prompts.

**Not suitable for:**
-   **Formal Business Communication**: Discord's style is entertainment-oriented and not suitable for serious instant messaging.
-   **1-on-1 Private Consultation**: Although DM is supported, Discord's strength lies in public channels.
