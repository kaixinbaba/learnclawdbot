# Fix: Cron Jobs and Heartbeat Not Working in OpenClaw

One of the most common issues OpenClaw users face is scheduled tasks not firing. You've set up a cron job or heartbeat, but nothing happens. This guide covers the most frequent causes and fixes.

## Quick Diagnosis

Before diving deep, run these checks:

```bash
# Check cron status
openclaw cron status

# List all scheduled jobs
openclaw cron list

# Check gateway logs for scheduler errors
tail -100 ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log | grep -i "cron\|heartbeat\|scheduler"
```

## Common Issue #1: Cron Jobs Never Fire

### Symptoms
- Jobs show as `enabled: true` but never execute
- No errors in logs, jobs just silently don't run
- `openclaw cron list` shows jobs but `lastRun` is always null

### Cause: Gateway Not Running or Restarted

Cron jobs only fire when the Gateway is running. If you:
- Closed your terminal
- Restarted your computer  
- Ran `openclaw gateway stop`

Your cron jobs stopped too.

### Fix

```bash
# Check if gateway is running
openclaw gateway status

# If not running, start it
openclaw gateway start

# Or restart to pick up config changes
openclaw gateway restart
```

**Pro tip:** Use `openclaw gateway start --daemon` to run in background, or set up a system service.

## Common Issue #2: Heartbeat Not Executing

### Symptoms
- Heartbeat poll configured but agent never responds
- No `HEARTBEAT_OK` or proactive messages
- Works fine when you message directly

### Cause A: Wrong wakeMode

The most common cause is using `wakeMode: "next-heartbeat"` without understanding what it means.

```json
// ❌ This waits for next heartbeat cycle, not immediate
{
  "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 1800000 },
  "payload": { "kind": "systemEvent", "text": "Check inbox" },
  "wakeMode": "next-heartbeat"
}
```

### Fix

For immediate execution, use `wakeMode: "now"` or omit it:

```json
// ✅ Fires immediately when scheduled
{
  "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 1800000 },
  "payload": { "kind": "systemEvent", "text": "Check inbox" }
}
```

### Cause B: Empty HEARTBEAT.md

If your `HEARTBEAT.md` file is empty or contains only comments, the agent correctly returns `HEARTBEAT_OK` and does nothing.

### Fix

Add actual tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md

- Check for unread emails (if not checked in last 2 hours)
- Review calendar for upcoming events in next 24h
- Check project status if any tasks are overdue
```

## Common Issue #3: One-Shot Jobs Loop Infinitely

### Symptoms
- Created a one-time job with `schedule.kind: "at"`
- Job fires repeatedly instead of once
- Status shows "skipped" but job keeps triggering

### Cause: deleteAfterRun Bug with Skipped Status

In some versions, one-shot jobs with `deleteAfterRun: true` don't delete properly when their status is "skipped".

### Fix

**Option 1:** Manually delete the job after it runs:
```bash
openclaw cron remove --id <job-id>
```

**Option 2:** Use a workaround schedule:
```json
{
  "schedule": { 
    "kind": "at", 
    "at": "2026-02-10T15:00:00Z"
  },
  "deleteAfterRun": true,
  "payload": { "kind": "systemEvent", "text": "Reminder: Call mom" }
}
```

**Option 3:** Update to the latest OpenClaw version where this is fixed.

## Common Issue #4: Isolated Session Jobs Don't Announce

### Symptoms
- `sessionTarget: "isolated"` jobs run but you never see output
- Job shows as completed in `openclaw cron runs`
- No message delivered to your chat

### Cause: Missing or Misconfigured Delivery

Isolated session jobs need explicit delivery configuration to announce results.

### Fix

Add `delivery` configuration:

```json
{
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Summarize today's news"
  },
  "delivery": {
    "mode": "announce",
    "channel": "telegram"  // or your channel
  }
}
```

## Common Issue #5: Time Zone Confusion

### Symptoms
- Jobs fire at wrong times
- 8:00 AM job fires at 3:00 AM or midnight
- Schedule looks correct but timing is off

### Cause: UTC vs Local Time

OpenClaw uses UTC by default. If you write:
```json
{ "kind": "at", "at": "2026-02-10T08:00:00" }
```
That's 8:00 AM **UTC**, not your local time.

### Fix

**Option 1:** Add timezone to your schedule:
```json
{
  "kind": "cron",
  "expr": "0 8 * * *",
  "tz": "Asia/Shanghai"  // or America/New_York, Europe/London, etc.
}
```

**Option 2:** Use ISO format with timezone offset:
```json
{
  "kind": "at",
  "at": "2026-02-10T08:00:00+08:00"
}
```

## Debugging Checklist

If none of the above fixes your issue, work through this checklist:

### 1. Verify Gateway is Running
```bash
openclaw gateway status
# Should show "running"
```

### 2. Check Job Configuration
```bash
openclaw cron list --include-disabled
# Verify schedule, payload, and enabled status
```

### 3. Review Recent Runs
```bash
openclaw cron runs --id <job-id> --limit 10
# Check status of recent executions
```

### 4. Check Logs for Errors
```bash
tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log | grep -E "cron|scheduler|heartbeat"
```

### 5. Test Manual Trigger
```bash
openclaw cron run --id <job-id>
# Forces immediate execution to test if job works
```

### 6. Validate JSON Syntax
```bash
# Check your config file for JSON errors
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | jq .
```

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always test with `openclaw cron run`** before relying on schedules
2. **Set up logging** to capture scheduler events
3. **Use explicit timezones** in all schedules
4. **Monitor with heartbeats** - set up a daily "I'm alive" job to catch silent failures
5. **Keep OpenClaw updated** - many scheduler bugs are fixed in newer versions

## Still Stuck?

If you've tried everything:

1. Check [OpenClaw GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues) for known bugs
2. Run `openclaw doctor` for automatic diagnostics
3. Share your config (redacted) in the [OpenClaw Discord](https://discord.com/invite/clawd)

Remember: Most cron issues come down to the gateway not running, timezone confusion, or missing delivery configuration. Start with those three.
