# What is WhatsApp Integration? (Pocket AI Assistant)

> WhatsApp Integration is an **instant messaging connection** used to **process tasks via AI in daily chats**, helping **users who want to use AI anytime, anywhere** to **quickly get information or process multimedia content** in **mobile chat scenarios**.

---

## In a Nutshell

- **The Problem It Solves**: Use AI directly in the most commonly used chat software without opening a dedicated App.
- **Its Core Value**: Zero learning cost, supports voice-to-text and image analysis.
- **Typical Use Cases**: Voice record inspiration while driving, send photos to ask for directions while traveling, quickly translate foreign language messages.

## 1. What is WhatsApp Integration?

WhatsApp integration is essentially **disguising OpenClaw as one of your WhatsApp contacts**.

You can understand it as **a 24/7 online private secretary**:
- When you send a message (text, voice, image) to it.
- It will automatically understand your intent and reply to you, just like a real person.

## 2. What Can It Do?

Typically, WhatsApp integration can be used for:

1.  **Process Voice Notes** (One sentence): Forward a long voice message directly to it, and it can summarize it into a concise text summary.
2.  **Visual Q&A**: Take a photo of ingredients in the fridge, ask it "What dishes can I cook tonight".
3.  **Multilingual Translation**: Directly forward foreign language text to it, quickly get translation results.

In actual products, common usages include:
-   **Voice Bookkeeping**: Hold to speak "Just spent 35 dollars on taxi", it automatically records into your Notion database (requires Notion integration).
-   **Image Text Extraction**: Take a photo of a book or document, it extracts editable text directly for you.
-   **Schedule Reminder**: Send a message "Remind me to meet at 9 am tomorrow", it will send you a message on time.

## 3. How to Use?

Generally, using WhatsApp integration involves 3 steps:

1.  **Step 1: Get Connection Code**
    Log in to the OpenClaw web backend, find the `WhatsApp` integration card, and click to generate an exclusive QR code or connection code.

2.  **Step 2: Scan to Bind**
    Use mobile WhatsApp to scan the QR code, or add the official number and send the connection code.

3.  **Step 3: Start Conversation**
    After receiving the "Binding Successful" reply, just send a "Hello" to it like chatting with a friend.

If you are using it for the first time:
-   **Recommend starting with [Voice to Text]**: This is the most amazing feature, try sending a 60-second voice message.
-   **Don't [Complex Commands] at first**: Use it as a chatbot first, get familiar with its temper.

## 4. Why Use WhatsApp Integration Like This?

The main reasons for recommending using AI via WhatsApp are:

-   **Reason 1: Extremely Shallow Entry**: No need to unlock phone to find App, WhatsApp is on the first screen, or even reply on lock screen.
-   **Reason 2: Native Experience**: Voice input, image sending are all operations you are most familiar with, no new interaction logic.
-   **Reason 3: Network Inclusivity**: WhatsApp is well optimized for weak network environments, instructions can be sent even where signal is poor.

If you choose to use web version or native App, you might encounter:
-   Need to login or wait for loading every time.
-   Tedious steps to upload images and recordings.

## 5. Who is it For? Who is it Not For?

**Suitable for:**
-   **Field Staff/Sales**: Often running outside, inconvenient to type, accustomed to using voice.
-   **Light AI Users**: Don't want to install new Apps, just want an AI to ask anytime.
-   **International Communicators**: People who rely heavily on WhatsApp for daily communication.

**Not suitable for:**
-   **Code Developers**: Can't view large blocks of code on mobile, also inconvenient to copy and paste.
-   **Long Form Writers**: WhatsApp input box is not suitable for writing long articles.
