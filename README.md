### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the project**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:WeNextDev/nexty.dev.git
cd nexty
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Environment configuration**

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`, then configure the necessary environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. **Configure Supabase**

Create a new project in Supabase and add the generated URL and anonymous key to your `.env.local` file.

5. **Configure Supabase auth**

Follow the screenshot tutorial in `/README/supabase/auth` (related documentation will be published soon).

6. **Execute database commands**

Log in to Supabase and execute all SQL files in the `/data` folder in the SQL Editor.

7. **Generate Supabase types.ts locally**

Run the following commands in your terminal:
```
supabase login

supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> --schema public > lib/supabase/types.ts
```

You'll need to run this command again whenever you update Supabase tables, policies, triggers, or functions.

8. **Configure Stripe (optional)**

If you need payment functionality, follow the screenshot tutorial in `/README/stripe` (related documentation will be published soon), then add the Stripe API keys to your `.env.local` file.
